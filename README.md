# CheckMark

Do you have your check lists organized in Markdown files somewhere? Your shopping list? Your todos? Then CheckMark is for you!

Read unchecked items directly from your watch - marking items dones is as easy as pressing select once. Perfect if you don't want to get out your phone while shopping!

This app can load Markdown files from any WebDAV-compatible URL (e.g. Nextcloud/OwnCloud). It only loads unchecked items, so that you can focus on what needs to be done now.

Check it out [in the appstore](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/691e287d23bdbb000998aff9) or [on Github](https://github.com/LeonMatthes/CheckMark).

# Why I built CheckMark?

This is the first pebble watch app I made, and I'm thus far very happy with it. My grocery list is organized as a long Markdown file in my personal Nextcloud. I just check items off via Nextcloud Notes. With this little app I can see only the unchecked items on my watch and check off items immediately from the watch.

This is super convenient as I don't have to pull out the phone all the time while shopping.

Because it is based on WebDAV, it can be used to query Markdown files from anywhere though, so you can use it for whatever you like :)
